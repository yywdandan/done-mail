## Why DoneMail

- **Simple deployment**: click Deploy to Cloudflare, keep the default settings, and create the admin key on first visit.
- **Centralized configuration**: manage Cloudflare Token, account, Worker, entry domain, share domain, and domain status in the console.
- **High-performance service**: full-text body search is backed by FTS, keeping search clear and responsive even over long messages.
- **Complete workflow**: fully covers receiving, searching, sending, attachments, sharing, automation, and public APIs.
- **Multi-domain management**: connect Cloudflare root domains and subdomains, then inspect DNS, Email Routing, and Worker forwarding state.
- **Automation**: trigger forwarding, HTTP requests, and Telegram notifications from mail conditions to reduce repetitive manual work.
- **Long-term self-hosting**: single-admin model with low maintenance, without tenants, complex permissions, or enterprise-suite overhead.

## Quick Deploy

Click Deploy to Cloudflare and follow the prompts. See the [documentation](https://sow.us.kg/deploy/one-click) for details.
